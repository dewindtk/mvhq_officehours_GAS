1 - How much ETH per NFT will you pay, if you mint 5 free (or 0.15 each) NFTs
    through a transaction which costs 237000 gas units with which you sent
    3700 GWEI prio fee on a block with 330 GWEI Base fee.

2 - How many gas units would it have cost, if the azuki contract owner minted
    200 azukis through the function devMint(), after the first auction mint 
    instead of before?

3 - If during the azuki Auction you had batch-minted 5 azukis 
    (and held onto all of them) what would be the difference in gas consumption 
    between transfering the last token you have minted compared to the first token.
